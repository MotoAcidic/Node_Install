## What is Node Install
Node Install is a collection of Masternode Projects and other projects that allows you to either compile from source for your masternode instance or
compile from source for your windows exe file. 
The reason for compiling from source is to eliminate the risk of downloading an infected release file that has ran wild through the Cryto Community.

### Installation
As a warning this will take a good amount of time since you will be compiling your own daemon and not using the provided one by the project.
For first time running the this use command bellow:

```
git clone https://github.com/MotoAcidic/Node_Install.git && cd Node_Install && bash start.sh
```

For returning users we will delete this repo and get a clean instance of it to keep it fully up to date:

```
rm -rf Node_Install && git clone https://github.com/MotoAcidic/Node_Install.git && cd Node_Install && bash start.sh
```

### All documents
All guides and help documents can be found here: [Documentation](https://github.com/MotoAcidic/Node_Install/tree/master/Docs)
All Supported projects can be found in the Documentation folder as well.

**Have fun, this is crypto after all!**
